    "explanation": "The CSS Box Model is a fundamental concept in CSS that describes how elements are rendered on a webpage as rectangular boxes. Each box consists of four main components: Content Box (the actual content of the element), Padding Box (transparent area around the content), Border Box (a line around the padding), and Margin Box (transparent area outside the border, separating it from other elements). Understanding this model is crucial for layout and spacing in web design."
