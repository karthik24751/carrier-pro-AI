    "question": "What is the Virtual DOM in React and how does it work?",
    "selected_option": "A direct representation of the browser's DOM, used for faster rendering.",
    "correct_option": "An in-memory representation of the actual DOM, allowing React to optimize updates by comparing a new virtual tree with the previous one.",
    "is_correct": false,
    "explanation": "The Virtual DOM (VDOM) is a lightweight, in-memory representation of the actual DOM. When the state of a component changes, React creates a new Virtual DOM tree. It then efficiently compares this new tree with the previous one using a 'diffing' algorithm. Only the necessary changes (the 'diff') are then applied to the real DOM, minimizing direct DOM manipulation and significantly improving performance, especially for complex UIs."
