    "is_correct": false,
    "explanation": "Immutability in React means that you do not directly modify state objects or props. Instead, whenever state needs to change, you create a new copy of the state with the desired modifications. This is beneficial for: 1. Predictability: Makes it easier to reason about how data changes. 2. Performance: React's reconciliation process relies on shallow comparisons, and creating new object references helps React detect changes more efficiently. 3. Debugging: Easier to track changes and debug issues. It is achieved using techniques like spread syntax (`...`), `Object.assign()`, or immutable utility libraries (e.g., Immer)."
