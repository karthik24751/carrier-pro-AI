    "question": "Describe the purpose of Webpack in a frontend project.",
    "selected_option": "A static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications, used to compile modules into a single bundle, manage assets, and provide development utilities.",
    "correct_option": "A static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications, used to compile modules into a single bundle, manage assets, and provide development utilities.",
    "is_correct": true,
    "explanation": "Webpack is a powerful static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. Its main purpose is to take various assets (JavaScript, CSS, images, fonts) and transform them into a production-ready bundle. It uses 'loaders' to process different file types and 'plugins' to perform custom operations like optimization, asset management, and environment variable injection. Webpack also offers development features like hot module replacement (HMR) for a faster development workflow.",
