    "question": "Explain the difference between let, const, and var in JavaScript.",
    "selected_option": "All three are block-scoped but differ in hoisting.",
    "correct_option": "var is function-scoped, let and const are block-scoped.",
    "is_correct": false,
    "explanation": "var is function-scoped, meaning its scope is the nearest function. let and const are block-scoped, meaning their scope is limited to the block (curly braces) in which they are defined. const declarations must be assigned at initialization and cannot be reassigned, though the contents of an object or array declared with const can be modified. let can be reassigned but not re-declared in the same same scope. var is hoisted to the top of its function or global scope, initialized with `undefined`, while let and const are also hoisted but remain in a 'temporal dead zone' until their declaration is processed."
