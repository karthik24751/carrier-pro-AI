    "question": "What is the Virtual DOM in React and how does it work?",
    "selected_option": "A direct representation of the browser's DOM, used for faster rendering.",
    "correct_option": "An in-memory representation of the actual DOM, allowing React to optimize updates by comparing a new virtual tree with the previous one.",
    "is_correct": false,
    "explanation": "The Virtual DOM (VDOM) is a lightweight, in-memory representation of the actual DOM. When the state of a component changes, React creates a new Virtual DOM tree. It then efficiently compares this new tree with the previous one using a 'diffing' algorithm. Only the necessary changes (the 'diff') are then applied to the real DOM, minimizing direct DOM manipulation and significantly improving performance, especially for complex UIs.",

        "Consider incorporating more key concepts. Missing: virtual dom, reconciliation, diffing",
